-   [ ] Familiarize yourself with Swagger's guidelines for API documentation. You can find the documentation on the
        Swagger website.

-   [ ] Review the mockups for the transactions page to get a better understanding of the functionality that needs to be
        implemented.

-   [ ] Discuss with your team to determine the requirements for the API. What data needs to be returned for each
        endpoint, what parameters are required, and what response codes should be returned for different scenarios?

-   [ ] Create a new Swagger project in the Swagger editor. You can use the online editor available on the Swagger website
        or download the editor to your computer.

-   [ ] Define the API endpoints based on the requirements discussed with your team. For each endpoint, specify the HTTP
        method, route, description, and possible parameters. You should also define the different responses with the
        corresponding response codes that make sense for this endpoint.

-   [ ] Export the Swagger project to a YAML file using Swagger syntax. You can do this by selecting "File > Save As YAML"
        in the Swagger editor.

-   [ ] Share the YAML file with your team for review.

-   [ ] Once the API proposal is reviewed and approved, start implementing the API endpoints on the back-end side.

-   [ ] Test the API endpoints thoroughly to ensure they are working as expected.

-   [ ] Submit the completed API documentation and code to your team for final review and testing.
